# Predictive-Modeling-of-Drug-Sensitivity-Using-Genomic-Data-using-R
In this project, I developed predictive models to estimate drug sensitivity (IC50 values) by leveraging genomic data, including gene mutations, copy number variations (CNA), and gene expression levels. 

The project involved preprocessing complex biological GDSC Dataset from Kaggle, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and implementing a Random Forest and XGBoost model for regression analysis.

Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were utilized to interpret the model, providing insights into feature importance and model behavior. The project was executed in both R and Python environments, with code structured in RStudio and a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating cross-platform proficiency.

This project showcases my ability to handle large-scale genomic data, apply advanced machine learning techniques, and produce interpretable models that can assist in biomarker discovery and precision medicine.
